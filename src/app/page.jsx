          SIP Calculator – Systematic Investment Plan Returns Estimator
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-5">
          Many investors often mix up mutual funds and SIPs, but they’re not the
          same. A<strong> Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)</strong> is simply a
          disciplined method of investing in mutual funds—bit by bit, at fixed
          intervals—rather than investing a large lump sum all at once. SIPs
          make market participation easier and more consistent for regular
          investors.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-5">
          The <strong>SIP Calculator</strong> is a practical tool that estimates
          how your investments could grow over time. It helps you understand the
          potential wealth creation from your monthly contributions, based on an
          expected rate of return. Whether you invest weekly, monthly, or
          quarterly, the calculator gives a clear snapshot of your estimated
          corpus at the end of your chosen tenure.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-5">
          SIPs have become one of the most popular ways to invest in mutual
          funds—especially among young investors seeking consistent and
          goal-oriented growth. With this SIP calculator, you can project your{" "}
          <strong>total investment, expected gains</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong>maturity amount</strong> in seconds. It’s designed for
          simplicity, accuracy, and smarter decision-making—helping you plan
          your financial journey with confidence.
